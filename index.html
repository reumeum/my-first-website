<h2>Sports Climbing</h2>
<p>Sport climbing (or bolted climbing) is a type of free climbing in rock climbing where the lead climber clips into pre-drilled permanent bolts for their protection while ascending the route.[1] Sport climbing differs from the riskier traditional climbing where the lead climber has to insert temporary protection equipment while they are ascending.</p>
<p>Sport climbing dates from the early 1980s when leading French rock climbers wanted to climb routes that offered no cracks or fissures in which to insert the temporary protection equipment used in traditional climbing. While bolting natural rock faces was controversial — and remains a focus of debate in climbing ethics — sport climbing grew rapidly in popularity, and all subsequent grade milestones in rock climbing has come from sport climbing.</p>
